1. What is a functional component?
A component we can call instead of create many lines of html.
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
functional components should be used over class components if possible.

2. What is a Class Component 
almost same a functional component, but class component has a few perks.

3. What is the idea with props
being able to read specific properties when calling components.

4. Provide a simple example in how you write a Component that accepts props
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

5. Provide a simple example (could be a line from the exercise above) that demonstrates how you pass in props to a Component
{} => {props} => {props.property} <-> {props.name}

1. Would it be possible to rewrite the Clock component into a functional component (provide arguments for your answer)?
No it isnt, since functional components are stateless.

2. How do you set values for state in these places: 1) In the constructor 2) all other places?
In the constructor.

3. How is it possible to "tell" React that you want the UI to be updated (re-rendered)?
With a componentDidMount, it runs after the dom has been rendered.

4. Which method, in the Clock class, is responsible for “forcing” a re-render
componentDidMount()

5. What is the difference(s) between state and props
props are read-only, state is dynamic

6. How do you pass in prop values to a Component
<Welcome name="Hello World" />

7. What is the purpose of React Components Life Cycle Methods?
Creation --> Growing --> Ending 
For everything.

1. Provide a small explanation for each of the outputs, the purpose of the override, and when you observed it to print.
Constructor is the first one to be called.
Then the render is called
componenetDidMount runs after the render.
Then tick is called to change the value of the clock
and render is called to render it to the componenetDidMount
The last two is looping every 1 second as stated in 
the componenetDidMount.
Tick --> Render --> Tick --> Render
Tick --> ComponentWillUpdate --> Render --> ComponentDidUpdate
